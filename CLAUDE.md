# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Huddle is a Claude Code skill that runs repo-aware, multi-persona engineering discussions. Users trigger it with phrases like "start a huddle" or "huddle up". The user drives all decisions; personas provide perspectives, then stop and wait.

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Preflight is three parallel calls.** `global_state.py` (cached in `userconfig.json`, ~1ms on warm cache), `project_state.py snapshot` (file reads + minimal git identity probes, recomputed once per session and bound to a variable), and `session_state.py` (live git/gh probes, never cached). Claude fires all three in one message so wall-clock ≈ the slowest.
- **Append-only raw writes, synthesis on demand.** During live discussion, NO file writes happen on normal rounds. On decisions/milestones, a single raw event JSON file is written directly to `{huddle_dir}/raw/` using the Write tool — no Python script, no background process. When the user asks for notes or wraps up, synthesis reads all `raw/*.json` + conversation context, writes `huddle-state.json` + `.md`, and deletes the raw files.
- **`huddle-state.json` is the synthesized source of truth** for all huddle state (decisions, participants, key moments, open questions, action items). Written only on explicit ask or wrap-up — not every round.
- **User-level config at `~/.config/muthuishere-agent-skills/userconfig.json`** stores `git_user`, `python_bin`, and `gh_available` — detected once globally on first ever huddle run, shared across all repos. Repo-level config at `~/.config/muthuishere-agent-skills/{reponame}/config.json` stores only repo-specific values (`reponame`, `owner_repo`, `default_branch`).
- **`PYTHON_BIN` detected once globally.** Stored in `userconfig.json` after first detection. All subsequent script calls use this variable. Never hardcode `python3` or `python`.
- **Graph views are derived on demand** by Elango from `huddle-state.json` + conversation context. The HTML review surface (`docs/index.html`) derives presentation client-side.
- **`activation-routing.xml`** is the central policy file. It defines modes (discussion, planning, verification, research, spec-review, wrap-up), flow-control rules, and disambiguation logic. Changes to huddle behavior almost always start here.
- **Steps execute in order** defined by `workflow.md`. Steps never skip; they stop and report on failure.
- **Personas are selected per-topic** (small room by default). The roster is in `persona-roster.xml`; full persona behavior is in individual markdown files under `references/personas/`.

## Scripts

All scripts are Python 3, stdlib-only, and output JSON to stdout.

| Script | Usage | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `global_state.py` | `python3 scripts/global_state.py` | Global, user-level state cached in `userconfig.json` — `git_user`, `python_bin`, `gh_available`, `persona_roster_xml`. First call detects and caches; subsequent calls are pure file reads (~1ms). Also spawns `migrate.py` detached on first-ever run. |
| `project_state.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/project_state.py snapshot <project_root>` (also `check\|read\|write`) | Repo-scoped state computed once per session. `snapshot` returns `reponame`, `owner_repo`, `branch`, huddle paths, project doc freshness, `cross_branch_context`, `raw_events`, and `saved_state`. File reads only; minimal cheap git identity probes. |
| `session_state.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/session_state.py <project_root> <date>` | Live probes, never cached. Parallel batch of `git status`, `git log --since=8h`, `git branch`, `git HEAD`, `gh pr list`. Also ensures today's huddle note file exists and reports `is_resume`. |
| `huddle_writer.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/huddle_writer.py <huddle_dir> '<event_json>'` | Standalone event writer for non-Claude agents (Codex, Copilot, Windsurf). Claude uses Write tool directly instead. |
| `config_helper.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/config_helper.py read\|get\|set\|bootstrap ...` | Per-repo config CRUD at `~/.config/muthuishere-agent-skills/{reponame}/config.json` |
| `repo_context.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/repo_context.py snapshot` | Gathers repo context (git state, PRs, remote info); supports non-git local-folder mode |
| `md_to_html.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/md_to_html.py <note.md> [base_url]` | Bundles huddle note + `huddle-state.json` into a gzip+base64 URL fragment and opens the hosted review page |
| `migrate.py` | `{PYTHON_BIN} scripts/migrate.py` | One-time migration from legacy `~/config/muthuishere-agent-skills/` to `~/.config/muthuishere-agent-skills/`. Spawned detached by `global_state.py` only when the new root doesn't yet exist. Idempotent; never overwrites existing targets. |

## Running Tests

```bash
python3 e2e/run.py
```

This smoke-tests the three preflight scripts (`global_state`, `project_state snapshot`, `session_state`), `md_to_html.py` bundling, and the one-time `migrate.py` flow. Uses a temp `$HOME` so it won't touch real config.

## State Storage Layout

```
~/.config/muthuishere-agent-skills/
  userconfig.json                # Global: git_user, python_bin, gh_available (detected once)
  {reponame}/
    config.json                  # Repo-scoped: reponame, owner_repo, default_branch
    project-state.json           # Project doc freshness metadata
    {branch}/huddle/
      huddle-state.json          # Synthesized state (written on demand/wrap-up only)
      {YYYY-MM-DD}.md            # Daily huddle note (written on demand/wrap-up only)
      raw/                       # Append-only event files (direct Write tool)
        {ts}_decision.json       # One file per decision
        {ts}_milestone.json      # One file per milestone
```

Branch names are sanitized for filesystem (`feature/login` -> `feature-login`). Cross-branch reads scan sibling branch folders for context.

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh    # Symlinks skill into ~/.claude/skills/huddle (or ~/.agents/skills/)
./uninstall.sh  # Removes the symlink
```

## Non-Git Mode

Huddle works without git. Falls back to local-folder mode using folder name as repo identity. Bootstrap a local identity with:
```bash
python3 scripts/config_helper.py bootstrap <project_root> [repo_name] [branch] [user]
```
