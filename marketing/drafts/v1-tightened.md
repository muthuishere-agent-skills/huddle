# The 80% Problem — And What LLMs Actually Changed

Every experienced engineer knows this moment.

APIs come together. Flows start working. The UI looks complete. Very quickly it feels like the system is 80% done. Everyone relaxes.

Then the second half begins.

In 1985, Tom Cargill of Bell Labs gave this pattern its name:

> "The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

Software doesn't get built linearly. It gets built in two phases that feel nothing alike.

**Phase 1** is fast and visible. Features appear. The demo works. Momentum is real.

**Phase 2** is slow and invisible. Edge cases appear. Assumptions break. Real usage arrives. This is where systems either harden or fall apart.

## What LLMs changed

Phase 1 has been compressed. With tools like Claude, you can move from idea to running code in an afternoon. You hit "80% done" faster than was possible a year ago.

Phase 2 is exactly as hard as it ever was.

Because the last 20% was never about writing code. It's about uncovering hidden assumptions, identifying failure paths, understanding real usage, and validating decisions under pressure.

Before LLMs, the bottleneck was *"can we build this?"* Now the bottleneck is *"did we think about this deeply enough?"*

## The scarce resource is questions

Answers are easy now. Anyone can generate code, architecture, or docs on demand. What's become rare is the ability to ask the right questions — the uncomfortable ones:

- What happens when this fails in production?
- Who controls this input?
- What assumption are we making here?
- Is this solving the real problem, or a version of it?

These questions decide whether a system survives first contact with users.

## They don't come from one voice

A developer sees implementation. A security engineer sees risk. A product person sees intent. A manager sees feasibility. Each asks different questions — and most of those questions arrive too late, in incident channels and retros.

**Huddle** exists to pull those questions to the front.

It runs repo-aware, multi-persona engineering discussions *before* the system is locked in. The developer sees what they'd otherwise discover too late. The manager gets the questions they didn't know how to ask. The security engineer is in the room before the breach, not after.

Better systems aren't built by faster answers. They're built by better questions, asked at the right time.
